# AHCI driver port

The initial header port translates FreeBSD `sys/dev/ahci/ahci.h` from
the FreeBSD source snapshot `c2b7fe4a9e94a0edba9dd2772874928b565c4f9e`
(BSD-2-Clause). Hardware offsets, bit encodings, DMA wire layouts, slot/error
states, and controller/channel bookkeeping map to Rust definitions in
`tk-axdriver-block::ahci::regs`. The FreeBSD bus/resource, mutex, callout and
CAM/CCB framework types are not carried over; subsequent AHCI code will map
storage requests to TheKernel's block-device interfaces.

This commit establishes definitions only. The PCI frontend, port engine,
ATA identify/read/write commands, NCQ/TRIM, recovery, and QEMU acceptance are
not yet implemented.
